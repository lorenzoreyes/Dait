or Data-it

It is an App where users can upload their tickets and save them as excels to analyze their own behavior, compare with others and make changes via applying recommendations

Study Case: Our own experience. We are used to have tickets of what we buy and anything, they serve as a document of what we did, but honestly as users no body keep track of that.
We want to gather that information, put it all together, analyze it and base of being able to study it perform some changes as we want.
